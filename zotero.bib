  abstract = {In the conventional frequency-domain waveform inversion, either multifrequency simultaneous inversion or sequential single-frequency inversion has been implemented. However, most conventional frequency-domain waveform inversion methods fail to recover background velocity when low-frequency information is missing. Recently, new waveform inversion techniques in the Laplace and Laplace\textendash Fourier domain have been proposed to recover background velocity structure from data with insufficient low-frequency information. In such techniques, however, all frequencies are inverted simultaneously, and this requires large computational resources and long computation times.In this paper, we propose a sequentially ordered single-frequency 2-D acoustic waveform inversion using the logarithmic objective function in the Laplace\textendash Fourier domain. Our algorithm sequentially inverts single-frequency data in the Laplace\textendash Fourier domain, thus reducing computational resources. Unlike most conventional waveform inversion methods requiring an initial velocity model close to the true model, we propose a one-step waveform inversion method in seeking to find a final velocity structure from the simple initial model through a hybrid combination of the Laplace domain inversion and the Fourier domain inversion.We adopt and evaluate the multiloop algorithm by modifying the double-loop algorithm commonly used in the conventional frequency-domain waveform inversion. Using the multiloop algorithm repeating loop over frequencies, the quality of the inversion results can be improved and the decision problem of the number of iterations for each frequency can be overcome effectively. Because the sequential order of the Laplace\textendash Fourier frequencies in a 2-D plane should be assigned for inverting Laplace\textendash Fourier frequency data consecutively, we present three different sequential orders of Laplace\textendash Fourier frequencies while considering the multiscale and layer-stripping approach, and we compare the inversion results from the numerical experiments.We applied the sequentially ordered single-frequency 2-D acoustic waveform inversion in the full Laplace\textendash Fourier domain to the synthetic seismic data produced from complex structure model and field data. A realistic model could be recovered in an efficient and robust manner, even using the two-layer homogeneous velocity model as an initial model. The inverted velocity model from the field data was validated by examining the migrated image from the pre-stack depth migration and the flattening of the common-image gathers or by comparing the synthetic shot gather with the real shot gather. The proposed one-step waveform inversion algorithm can be easily extended to the sequential inversion of 3-D acoustic or elastic data in the full Laplace\textendash Fourier domain.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a waveform matching procedure which can potentially provide subsurface models with a wavelength-scale resolution. However, sophisticated regularization techniques are required to decrease the sensitivity of FWI to the initial model and noise and reduce the ill-posedness of the problem resulting from uneven illumination. The subsurface may be considered as a combination of a blocky part and a smoothly-varying part. Due to the difference in statistical properties of each part, different techniques are needed to regularize them. To tackle this issue, we propose a new hybrid regularization method, which combines Tikhonov and total-variation (TV) regularizers. The Tikhonov regularization is used to stabilize the reconstruction of the smoothly-varying background part of the subsurface, while the TV regularization is used for recovering the large contrasts associated with salt bodies for example. The new Tikhonov-TV (TT) regularization is implemented in frequency-domain FWI based on wavefield reconstruction, an efficient penalty method to extend the parameter-search space, using an iterative refinement strategy and the split Bregman technique. The relevance of the TT-regularized FWI is illustrated with two synthetic examples, a toy example and a target of the large-contrast 2004 BP salt model. The results show that the TT method outperforms the TV method in recovering both the smooth and blocky parts of the subsurface.},

Pyramid algorithms replace an operation on a single high order polynomial by a recursive sequence of self-similar affine combinations, and are ubiquitous in computer aided geometric design for computations involving high order curves and surfaces. Pyramid algorithms have received no attention whatsoever from the high (or low) order finite element community. We  develop and analyze pyramid algorithms for the efficient handling of all of the basic finite element building blocks, including the assembly of the element load vectors and element stiffness matrices. The complexity of the algorithm for generating the element stiffness matrix is optimal. A new, nonuniform order, variant of the de Casteljau algorithm is developed that is applicable to the variable polynomial order case but incurs no additional complexity compared with the original algorithm. The work provides the methodology that enables the efficient use of a completely general distribution of polynomial degrees without any restriction in changes between adjacent cells, in any number of spatial dimensions.},

The classical mesh adaptation scheme appears inappropriate when dealing with such problems. Hence, another approach based on a new mesh adaptation algorithm and a metric intersection in time procedure, suitable for capturing and track such phenomena, is proposed. More precisely, the classical approach is generalized by inserting a new specific loop in the main adaptation loop in order to solve a transient fixed point problem for the mesh\textendash solution couple. To perform the anisotropic metric intersection operation, we apply the simultaneous reduction of the corresponding quadratic form. Regarding the adaptation scheme, an anisotropic geometric error estimate based on a bound of the interpolation error is proposed. The resulting computational metric is then defined using the Hessian of the solution. The mesh adaptation stage (surface and volume) is based on the generation, by global remeshing, of a unit mesh with respect to the prescribed metric. A 2D model problem is used to illustrate the difficulties encountered. Then, 2D and 3D complexes and representative examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of this method.},

  abstract = {Recent interest in finite-difference modeling of the wave equation has raised questions regarding the degree of match between finite-difference solutions and solutions obtained by the more classical analytical approaches. This problem is studied by means of a comparison of seismograms computed for receivers located in the vicinity of a 90-degree wedge embedded in an infinite two-dimensional acoustic medium. The calculations were carried out both by the finite-difference method and by a more conventional eigenfunction expansion technique. The results indicate the solutions are in good agreement provided that the grid interval for the finite-difference method is sufficiently small. If the grid is too coarse, the signals computed by the finite-difference method become strongly dispersed, and agreement between the two methods rapidly deteriorates. This effect, known as ``grid dispersion,'' must be taken into account in order to avoid erroneous interpretation of seismograms obtained by finite-difference techniques. Both second-order accuracy and fourth-order accuracy finite-difference algorithms are considered. For the second-order scheme, a good rule of thumb is that the ratio of the upper half-power wavelength of the source to the grid interval should be of the order of ten or more. For the fourth-order scheme, it is found that the grid can be twice as coarse (five or more grid points per upper half-power wavelength) and good results are still obtained. Analytical predictions of the effect of grid dispersion are presented; these seem to be in agreement with the experimental results.},

Many fundamental problems in interpolation and approximation give rise to interesting linear algebra questions. Previously, we gave block-structured algorithms for inverting the Bernstein mass matrix on simplicial cells, but did not study fast alorithms for the univariate case. Here, we give several approaches to inverting the univariate mass matrix based on exact formulae for the inverse; decompositions of the inverse in terms of Hankel, Toeplitz, and diagonal matrices; and a spectral decomposition. In particular, the eigendecomposition can be explicitly constructed in \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(n\^2)\$ operations, while its accuracy for solving linear systems is comparable to that of the Cholesky decomposition. Moreover, we study conditioning and accuracy of these methods from the standpoint of the effect of roundoff error in the \$L\^2\$ norm on polynomials, showing that the conditioning in this case is far less extreme than in the standard 2-norm.},

This last term is the way to smoothly introduce prior information into the FWI workflow. On a selected target of the Marmousi synthetic example, significant improvement was obtained when using the prior model term for noise-free and noisy synthetic data. The prior model term may significantly reduce the inversion sensitivity to incorrect initial conditions. The limited range of spatial wavenumber sampling by the acquisition may be compensated with the prior model information, for multiple-free and multiple-contaminated data. Prior and initial models play different roles in the inversion scheme. The starting model is used for wave propagation and therefore drives the data-misfit gradient, whereas the prior model is never explicitly used for solving the wave equation and only drives the optimization step as an additional constraint to minimize the total objective function. Thus, the prior model is not required to follow kinematic properties as precisely as the initial model, except in zones of poor illumination. In addition, we investigate the influence of a simple dynamic decreasing weighting of the prior model term. Once the cycle-skipping problem has been solved, the impact of the prior model term is gradually reduced within the misfit function to be driven by seismic-data only.

Locally implicit time discretizations are then of great interest. They indeed allow using unconditionally stable schemes in the regions of computational domain covered by small cells. The receivable values of the time step are then increased which reduces the computational costs while limiting the dispersion effects. In this work we construct a method that combines optimized explicit schemes and implicit schemes to form locally implicit schemes for linear ODEs, including in particular semidiscretized wave problems that are considered herein for numerical experiments. Both the explicit and implicit schemes used are one-step methods constructed using their stability function. The stability function of the explicit schemes are computed by maximizing the time step that can be chosen. The implicit schemes used are unconditionally stable and do not necessary require the same number of stages as the explicit schemes. The performance assessment we provide shows a very good level of accuracy for locally implicit schemes. It also shows that a locally implicit scheme is a good compromise between purely explicit and purely implicit schemes in terms of computational time and memory usage.},

Although finite difference methods on structured grids are used most frequently for this kind of problems, for local mesh refinement and coarsening it is much more convenient to work on unstructured meshes. We shall present some numerical experiments on aligned grids for solving the Euler equation of gas dynamics. This means, the shape and the alignment of the triangles is automatically controlled by a mesh indicator. The indicator, e.g. the gradient of the Mach number, is still a heuristical tool but it turns out, that the resolution of shocks are much better on locally aligned grids than on locally refined grids without alignment.},

Seismic sections across the Canadian Foothills are usually progressively more distorted when approaching the Canadian Foothills region. Figure 1 shows the degree of structural complexity and topographic variations which are in part responsible for the deteriorated imaging in the thrust belt. Accurate velocity models of subsurface structures are critical for improving seismic images of thrust belts in both the time domain (e.g., tomostatics) and the depth domain (e.g., prestack depth migration).},

A strategy for choosing optimal frequency bands is proposed to achieve computational efficiency in the time domain. A staggered-grid, explicit finite-difference method with fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time is used for forward modeling and the adjoint calculation. The adjoint method is utilized in inverting for an efficient computation of the gradient directions. In the multiscale approach, multifrequency data and multiple grid sizes are used to overcome somewhat the severe local minima problem of waveform tomography. The method is applied successfully to 1D and 2D heterogeneous models; it can accurately recover low- and high-wavenumber components of the velocity models. The inversion result for the 2D model demonstrates that the multiscale method is computationally efficient and converges faster than a conventional, single-scale method.},

This procedure endows the method with a much wider region of convergence than other methods (occasionally, even global convergence) and enables it to find multiple solutions of g(x) = 0 one after the other. The principal limitations of the method relate to the extraneous singularities of the differential equation. The role of these singularities is illustrated by several examples. In addition, the extension of the method to the problem of finding multiple extrema of a function of N variables is explained and some examples are given.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive validation of 2-D, frequency-domain, acoustic  wave-equation tomography was undertaken in a `blind test', using third-party, realistic, elastic wave-equation data. The synthetic 2-D, wide-angle seismic data were provided prior to a recent workshop on the methods of controlled source seismology; the true model was not revealed to the authors until after the presentation of our waveform tomography results. The original model was specified on a detailed grid with variable P-wave velocity, S-wave velocity, density and viscoelastic Q-factor structure, designed to simulate a section of continental crust 250 km long and 40 km deep. Synthetic vertical and horizontal component data were available for 51 shot locations (spaced every 5 km), recorded at 2779 receivers (spaced every 90 m), evenly spread along the surface of the model. The data contained energy from 0.2 to 15 Hz. Waveform tomography, a combination of traveltime tomography and 2-D waveform inversion of the early arrivals of the seismic waveforms, was used to recover crustal P-velocity structure from the vertical component data, using data from 51 sources, 1390 receivers and frequencies between 0.8 and 7.0 Hz. The waveform tomography result contained apparent structure at wavelength-scale resolution that was not evident on the traveltime tomography result. The predicted (acoustic) waveforms in the final result matched the original elastic data to a high degree of accuracy. During the workshop, the exact model was revealed; over much of the model the waveform tomography results provided a good correspondence with the true model, from large- to intermediate-(wavelength) scales, with a resolution limit on the order of 1 km. A significant, near-surface low-velocity zone, invisible to traveltime methods, was correctly recovered; the results also provided a high-resolution image of the complex structure of the entire crust, and the depth and nature of the crust-mantle transition. Some inaccuracies were observed near the edges of the images due to the limited ray coverage inherent to the footprint of the survey geometry. Several aspects of the waveform tomography strategy were critical to the success of the acoustic method with realistic, synthetic, viscoelastic data: (i) the accuracy of the starting model from traveltime tomography, (ii) implementation in the frequency domain, (iii) the use of complex-valued frequencies to effect time damping of the data residuals, (iv) the selection of a suitable subset of data and data frequencies, (v) progressive inversion of low- to high-frequency components of the data, (vi) initial, pre-inversion matching of the amplitudes between observed and modelled data, and (vii) sufficient preconditioning of both the data and the update images. Combined, these strategies were effectively equivalent to a multiscale approach that mitigated the non-linearity of the seismic inverse problem. During the inversion we carried out repeated forward modelling to ensure our modelled waveforms matched the observed data as closely as possible in both frequency and time domains. The synthetic data set used in this paper provides a benchmark for future testing of modelling, inversion, and imaging algorithms for wide-angle lithospheric imaging.},

  abstract = {Quantitative imaging of the elastic properties of the subsurface at depth is essential for civil engineering applications and oil- and gas-reservoir characterization. A realistic synthetic example provides for an assessment of the potential and limits of 2D elastic full-waveform inversion (FWI) of wide-aperture seismic data for recovering high-resolution P- and S-wave velocity models of complex onshore structures. FWI of land data is challenging because of the increased nonlinearity introduced by free-surface effects such as the propagation of surface waves in the heterogeneous near-surface. Moreover, the short wavelengths of the shear wavefield require an accurate S-wave velocity starting model if low frequencies are unavailable in the data. We evaluated different multiscale strategies with the aim of mitigating the nonlinearities. Massively parallel full-waveform inversion was implemented in the frequency domain. The numerical optimization relies on a limited-memory quasi-Newton algorithm thatoutperforms the more classic preconditioned conjugate-gradient algorithm. The forward problem is based upon a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method on triangular mesh, which allows accurate modeling of free-surface effects. Sequential inversions of increasing frequencies define the most natural level of hierarchy in multiscale imaging. In the case of land data involving surface waves, the regularization introduced by hierarchical frequency inversions is not enough for adequate convergence of the inversion. A second level of hierarchy implemented with complex-valued frequencies is necessary and provides convergence of the inversion toward acceptable P- and S-wave velocity models. Among the possible strategies for sampling frequencies in the inversion, successive inversions of slightly overlapping frequency groups is the most reliable when compared to the more standard sequential inversion of single frequencies. This suggests that simultaneous inversion of multiple frequencies is critical when considering complex wave phenomena.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is an appealing seismic data-fitting procedure for the derivation of highresolution quantitative models of the subsurface at various scales. Full modelling and inversion of viscoelastic waves from multiple seismic sources allow for the recovering of different physical parameters, although they remain computationally challenging tasks. An efficient massively parallel, frequencydomain FWI algorithm is implemented here on large-scale distributed-memory platforms for imaging two-dimensional visco-elastic media. The resolution of the elastodynamic equations, as the forward problem of the inversion, is performed in the frequency domain on unstructured triangular meshes, using a low-order finite element discontinuous Galerkin method. The linear system resulting from discretization of the forward problem is solved with a parallel direct solver. The inverse problem, which is presented as a non-linear local optimization problem, is solved in parallel with a quasi-Newton method, and this allows for reliable estimation of multiple classes of visco-elastic parameters. Two levels of parallelism are implemented in the algorithm, based on message passing interfaces and multi-threading, for optimal use of computational time and the core-memory resources available on modern distributed-memory multicore computational platforms. The algorithm allows for imaging of realistic targets at various scales, ranging from near-surface geotechnic applications to crustal-scale exploration.},

The presence of local minima at all scales in the seismic inversion problem prevent iterative methods of inversion from attaining a reasonable degree of convergence to the neighborhood of the global minimum. The multigrid method is a technique that improves the performance of iterative inversion by decomposing the problem by scale. At long scales there are fewer local minima and those that remain are further apart from each other. Thus, at long scales iterative methods can get closer to the neighborhood of the global minimum. We apply the multigrid method to a subsampled, low-frequency version of the Marmousi data set. Although issues of source estimation, source bandwidth, and noise are not treated, results show that iterative inversion methods perform much better when employed with a decomposition by scale. Furthermore, the method greatly reduces the computational burden of the inversion that will be of importance for 3-D extensions to the method.},

In the standard DG method, the dispersion and dissipation errors and the spectrum of the semidiscrete scheme are related to the \$[\textbackslash frac\{p\}\{p+1\}]\$ Pad\'e approximants of \$\textbackslash exp(z)\$ and \$\textbackslash exp(-z)\$. These Pad\'e approximants are responsible for the superconvergent \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(h\^\{2p+2\})\$ and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(h\^\{2p+1\})\$ errors in dispersion and dissipation, respectively, and the restriction of the CFL number when increasing the order of approximation, \$p\$. By modifying the DG method we obtain different rational approximations of the exponential, thereby sacrificing some of the superconvergence of the method, and construct new schemes which allow larger time steps than the original DG method, while having the same order of convergence in the \$\textbackslash mathcal\{L\}\^2\$ norm. This is achieved through modifications to the  numerical flux. The schemes preserve the attractive properties of the usual DG method, such as the high order accuracy and compact stencil.},

In applications where the wavespeed varies spatially at a sub-element scale, these matrices are distinct over each element, necessitating additional storage. In this work, we propose a weight-adjusted DG (WADG) method which reduces storage costs by replacing the weighted L2 inner product with a weight-adjusted inner product. This equivalent inner product results in an energy stable method, but does not increase storage costs for locally varying weights. A priori error estimates are derived, and numerical examples are given illustrating the application of this method to the acoustic wave equation with heterogeneous wavespeed.},

  abstract = {Summary It has been proven that full waveform inversion (FWI) based on optimal transport (OT) is robust against noise and contains less local minima. The accurate solution to OT problem on the real line (1D) is analytical with the selected distance function which can be effectively and non-iteratively solved by numerical interpolation. Currently finding an accurate optimal transport plan in higher dimension is known to be expensive even if it exists. The seismic data are naturally sampled in higher dimension and typically considered to be large scale. Given shot gathers from 2D survey, when calculating the misfit along one direction only, the information in other directions would be under-determined. In this paper, we introduce sliced Wasserstein distance to calculate the transport plan function in the lower dimensions of transformed domain such that other directions are considered implicitly. The extra cost caused by radon transform as compared to its counterpart based on \$L\_2\$ norm is negligible. Numerical examples indicate that misfit based on sliced Wasserstein distance can improve the efficiency of FWI and shows the capacity for salt velocity building.},

We apply this method to the earthquake location problem. For this problem, the seismic stations are far from each other. Thus, the trace by trace comparison [Yang et al., arXiv(2016)] is a natural way to compare the earthquake signals. Under this framework, we have derived a concise analytic expression of the Fr\textbackslash `echet gradient of the Wasserstein metric, which leads to a simple and efficient implementation for the adjoint method. We square and normalize the earthquake signals for comparison so that the convexity of the misfit function with respect to earthquake hypocenter and origin time can be observed numerically. To reduce the impact of noise, which can not offset each other after squaring the signals, a new control parameter is introduced. Finally, the LMF (Levenberg-Marquardt-Fletcher) method is applied to solve the resulted optimization problem. According to the numerical experiments, only a few iterations are required to converge to the real earthquake hypocenter and origin time. Even for data with noise, we can obtain reasonable and convergent numerical results.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we give a simple introduction to the devising of discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. These methods have recently made their way into the main stream of computational fluid dynamics and are quickly finding use in a wide variety of applications. The DG methods, which are extensions of finite volume methods, incorporate into a finite element framework the notions of approximate Riemann solvers, numerical fluxes and slope limiters coined during the remarkable development of the high-resolution finite difference and finite volume methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. We start by stressing the fact that nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws are usually obtained from well-posed problems by neglecting terms modeling nondominant features of the model which, nevertheless, are essential in crucial, small parts of the domain; as a consequence, the resulting problem becomes ill-posed. The main difficulty in devising numerical schemes for these conservation laws is thus how to re-introduce the neglected physical information in order to approximate the physically relevant solution, usually called the entropy solution. For the classical case of the entropy solution of the nonlinear hyperbolic scalar conservation law, we show how to carry out this process for two prototypical DG methods. The first DG method is the so-called shock-capturing DG method, which does not use slope limiters and is implicit; the second is the Runge\textendash Kutta DG method, which is an explicit method that does not employ a shock-capturing term but uses a slope limiter instead. We then focus on the Runge\textendash Kutta DG methods and show how to obtain a key stability property which holds independently of the accuracy of the scheme and of the nonlinearity of the conservation law; we also show some computational results.},

We present the discontinuous Galerkin methods and describe and discuss their main features. Since the methods use completely discontinuous approximations, they produce mass matrices that are block-diagonal. This renders the methods highly parallelizable when applied to hyperbolic problems. Another consequence of the use of discontinuous approximations is that these methods can easily handle irregular meshes with hanging nodes and approximations that have polynomials of different degrees in different elements. They are thus ideal for use with adaptive algorithms. Moreover, the methods are locally conservative (a property highly valued by the computational fluid dynamics community) and, in spite of providing discontinuous approximations, stable, and high-order accurate. Even more, when applied to non-linear hyperbolic problems, the discontinuous Galerkin methods are able to capture highly complex solutions presenting discontinuities with high resolution. In this paper, we concentrate on the exposition of the ideas behind the devising of these methods as well as on the mechanisms that allow them to perform so well in such a variety of problems.},

  abstract = {After every major earthquake, the Earth rings like a bell for several days. These free oscillations of the Earth and the related propagating body and surface waves are routinely detected at broad-band seismographic stations around the world. In this book, F. A. Dahlen and Jeroen Tromp present an advanced theoretical treatment of global seismology, describing the normal-mode, body-wave, and surface-wave methods employed in the determination of the Earth's three-dimensional internal structure and the source mechanisms of earthquakes. The authors provide a survey of both the history of global seismological research and the major theoretical and observational advances made in the past decade. The book is divided into three parts. In the first, "Foundations," Dahlen and Tromp give an extensive introduction to continuum mechanics and discuss the representation of seismic sources and the free oscillations of a completely general Earth model. The resulting theory should provide the basis for future scientific discussions of the elastic-gravitational deformation of the Earth. The second part, "The Spherical Earth," is devoted to the free oscillations of a spherically symmetric Earth. In the third part, "The Aspherical Earth," the authors discuss methods of dealing with the Earth's three-dimensional heterogeneity. The book is concerned primarily with the forward problem of global seismology--detailing how synthetic seismograms and spectra may be calculated and interpreted. As a long-needed unification of theories in global seismology, the book will be important to graduate students and to professional seismologists, geodynamicists, and geomagnetists, as well as to astronomers who study the free oscillations of the Sun and other stars.},

  abstract = {Most of the approaches designed to avoid cycle skipping in full-waveform inversion (FWI) involve calculating a sequence of inversions in a multiscale fashion. We have adopted an alternative strategy, which is inverting a sequence of different misfit functions in the time domain. This is an implicit multiscale approach in the sense that the used misfit functions are sensitive to different wavelengths, but all of the inversion steps use the same modeling algorithm and the same model grid. In the first and third inversion steps, the transmitted (early arrivals) and reflected (late arrivals) components of the wavefield envelopes are respectively fitted. The second step promotes a smooth transition between the first and third steps, by using the envelope of the complete waveform. Because fitting just the envelope of the reflected waves has a minor effect on the misfit function of the whole data set, the phases of the reflected waves are mostly fitted in the fourth step, which is based on the waveform misfit function preserving only the late arrivals. The third and fourth steps are of crucial importance to fit the reflected events. We test the sequential inversion approach with the Marmousi model using data sets with different frequencies, obtaining better estimates of the velocity field than those obtained with the classic FWI. The solutions obtained with classic FWI and sequential inversion approach degrade with a progressively higher peak frequency data set, but the classic FWI solution degrades more rapidly.},

  abstract = {This book sets out to explain what genetic algorithms are and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. The first objective is tackled by the editor, Lawrence Davis. The remainder of the book is turned over to a series of short review articles by a collection of authors, each explaining how genetic algorithms have been applied to problems in their own specific area of interest. The first part of the book introduces the fundamental genetic algorithm (GA), explains how it has traditionally been designed and implemented and shows how the basic technique may be applied to a very simple numerical optimisation problem. The basic technique is then altered and refined in a number of ways, with the effects of each change being measured by comparison against the performance of the original. In this way, the reader is provided with an uncluttered introduction to the technique and learns to appreciate why certain variants of GA have become more popular than others in the scientific community. Davis stresses that the choice of a suitable representation for the problem in hand is a key step in applying the GA, as is the selection of suitable techniques for generating new solutions from old. He is refreshingly open in admitting that much of the business of adapting the GA to specific problems owes more to art than to science. It is nice to see the terminology associated with this subject explained, with the author stressing that much of the field is still an active area of research. Few assumptions are made about the reader's mathematical background. The second part of the book contains thirteen cameo descriptions of how genetic algorithmic techniques have been, or are being, applied to a diverse range of problems. Thus, one group of authors explains how the technique has been used for modelling arms races between neighbouring countries (a non- linear, dynamical system), while another group describes its use in deciding design trade-offs for military aircraft. My own favourite is a rather charming account of how the GA was applied to a series of scheduling problems. Having attempted something of this sort with Simulated Annealing, I found it refreshing to see the authors highlighting some of the problems that they had encountered, rather than sweeping them under the carpet as is so often done in the scientific literature. The editor points out that there are standard GA tools available for either play or serious development work. Two of these (GENESIS and OOGA) are described in a short, third part of the book. As is so often the case nowadays, it is possible to obtain a diskette containing both systems by sending your Visa card details (or \$60) to an address in the USA.}

Yet when the region of local mesh refinement itself contains a sub-region of even smaller elements, any local time-step again will be overly restricted. To remedy the repeated bottleneck caused by hierarchical mesh refinement, multi-level local time-stepping methods are proposed, which permit the use of the appropriate time-step at every level of mesh refinement. Based on the LTS methods from Diaz and Grote (2009), these multi-level LTS methods are explicit, yield arbitrarily high accuracy and conserve the energy.

The present work is an extension of a previously proposed mesh-only (h-)adaptation method which uses both a continuous mesh, and a corresponding high-order continuous interpolation operator. In this previous formulation local anisotropy and global mesh density distribution may be determined by analytical optimization techniques, operating on the continuous mesh model. The addition of varying polynomial degree necessitates a departure from purely analytic optimization. However, we show in this article that a global optimization problem may still be formulated and solved by analytic optimization, adding only the necessity to solve numerically a single nonlinear algebraic equation per adaptation step to satisfy a constraint on the total number of degrees of freedom. The result is a tailorsuited continuous mesh with respect to a model for the global interpolation error measured in the Lq-norm. From the continuous mesh a discrete triangular mesh may be generated using any metric-based mesh generator.},

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is rapidly becoming a standard tool for high-resolution velocity estimation. However, the application of this method is usually limited to low frequencies due to the high computational cost of the wavefield propagation and the inversion scheme. To mitigate this problem, we have developed a rapid expansion method (REM) for numerical wavefield extrapolation inside the FWI workflow. This method approximated the partial time derivative of the wave equation using Chebyshev polynomials instead of the conventional finite-difference (FD) approximation. This allowed the REM to accurately propagate wavefields with bigger time steps, thus improving the computational efficiency of FWI. We have compared high-frequency FWI results using REM and the traditional FD approximation of the time derivative to illustrate the ability of REM to remain stable and free of numerical dispersion noise even with large grid and time samplings. In addition, we studied a step-length estimation scheme with the objective of avoiding an extra forward wavefield propagation during the line search at each FWI iteration. In this scheme, we estimated the step-length value based on prior iterations and validated this value using the Wolfe conditions. If the value was accepted, then the forward modeling was availed in the next iteration and no extra propagation was necessary. We tried seven different step-length estimation methods, from which we highlighted the adaptive Barzilai-Borwein method when combined with the steepest-descent inversion scheme, and the unitary step length for the L-BFGS algorithm. Through synthetic numerical results, we showed how this scheme could achieve convergence, while keeping the number of extra forward modelings way below the number of FWI iterations.},

This allows direct integration of the semi-discrete scheme in time and can be done for arbitrary order of accuracy in space and time. The resulting fully discrete scheme in time does not need more memory than an explicit first order Euler time-stepping scheme. This becomes possible because of an extensive use of the governing equations inside the numerical scheme itself via the so-called Cauchy\textendash Kovalewski procedure. We give an efficient algorithm for this procedure for the special case of the nonlinear two-dimensional Euler equations. Numerical convergence results for the nonlinear Euler equations results up to 8th order of accuracy in space and time are shown},

The method combines outer Gauss\textendash Newton nonlinear iterations with inner conjugate gradient linear iterations, globalized by an Armijo backtracking line search, solved on a sequence of finer grids and higher frequencies to remain in the vicinity of the global optimum, inexactly terminated to prevent oversolving, preconditioned by L-BFGS/Frankel, regularized by a total variation operator to capture sharp interfaces, finely discretized by finite elements in the Lam\'e parameter space to provide flexibility and avoid bias, implemented in matrix-free fashion with adjoint-based computation of reduced gradient and reduced Hessian-vector products, checkpointed to avoid full spacetime waveform storage, and partitioned spatially across processors to parallelize the solutions of the forward and adjoint wave equations and the evaluation of gradient-like information. Several numerical examples demonstrate the grid independence of linear and nonlinear iterations, the effectiveness of the preconditioner, the ability to solve inverse problems with up to 17 million inversion parameters on up to 2048 processors, the effectiveness of multiscale continuation in keeping iterates in the basin of attraction of the global minimum, and the ability to fit the observational data while reconstructing the model with reasonable resolution and capturing sharp interfaces.},

Originally introduced by Sergei Natanovich Bernstein to facilitate a constructive proof of the Weierstrass approximation theorem, the leisurely convergence rate of Bernstein polynomial approximations to continuous functions caused them to languish in obscurity, pending the advent of digital computers. With the desire to exploit the power of computers for geometric design applications, however, the Bernstein form began to enjoy widespread use as a versatile means of intuitively constructing and manipulating geometric shapes, spurring further development of basic theory, simple and efficient recursive algorithms, recognition of its excellent numerical stability properties, and an increasing diversification of its repertoire of applications. This survey provides a brief historical perspective on the evolution of the Bernstein polynomial basis, and a synopsis of the current state of associated algorithms and applications.},

In this paper, we present two approaches to computing symmetric triangle rules for singular integrands by developing rules that can integrate arbitrary functions. The first approach is well suited for a moderate amount of points and retains much of the efficiency of polynomial quadrature rules.

The main feature of the method is the use of plane waves instead of polynomials to approximate the solution in each element. The method is formulated for a general system of linear hyperbolic equations and is applied to problems of aeroacoustic propagation by solving the two-dimensional linearized Euler equations. It is found that the method requires only a small number of elements per wavelength to obtain accurate solutions and that it is more efficient than high-order DRP schemes. In addition, the conditioning of the method is found to be high but not critical in practice. It is shown that the Ultra-Weak Variational Formulation is in fact a subset of the present discontinuous Galerkin method. A special extension of the method is devised in order to deal with singular solutions generated by point sources like monopoles or dipoles. Aeroacoustic problems with non-uniform flows are also considered and results are presented for the sound radiated from a two-dimensional jet.},

Our algorithms are tailored to take advantage of the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) architecture of graphic processing units. The time integration is accelerated by local time stepping based on a multi-rate Adams-Bashforth scheme. A total variational bounded limiter is adopted for nonlinear stability of the numerical scheme. This limiter is coupled with a mass and momentum conserving positivity preserving limiter for the special treatment of a dry or partially wet element in the triangulation. Accuracy, robustness and performance are demonstrated with the aid of test cases. We compare the performance of the kernels expressed in a portable threading language OCCA, when cross compiled with OpenCL, CUDA, and OpenMP at runtime.},

  abstract = {When dealing with CFD problems, mesh adaptation is interesting for its ability to approach the asymptotic convergence and to obtain an accurate prediction for complex flows at a lower cost. Anisotropic mesh adaptation method reduces the number of degrees of freedom required to reach a given solution accuracy, thus impact favorably the CPU time. Moreover, it reduces the numerical scheme dissipation by automatically taking into account the anisotropy of the physical phenomena inside the mesh. Two main approaches exist in the literature. Feature-based mesh adaptation which is mainly deduced from an interpolation error estimate using the Hessian of the chosen sensor controls the interpolation error of the sensor over the whole computational domain. Such approach is easy to set-up and has a wide range of application, but it does not take into account the considered PDE used to solve the problem. On the other hand, goal-oriented mesh adaptation, which focuses on a scalar output function, takes into consideration both the solution and the PDE in the error estimation thanks to the adjoint state. But, the design of such error estimate is much more complicated. This thesis presents the results obtained with different CFD methods : the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) flow solvers with explicit and implicit schemes are presented and coupled to the moving mesh process, the feature-based unsteady mesh adaptation for moving geometries takes into account the changes of connectivites during the whole simulation, the adjoint state is extended to moving geometries problems and goal-oriented unsteady mesh adaptation for moving meshes is derived from an a priori error estimate. Several numerical examples are considered in the aeronautics sector and the field of civil security.},

Using gradient methods leads to iterative algorithms, each iteration implying a forward propagation generated by the actual sources, a backward propagation generated by the data residuals (acting as if they were sources), and a correlation at each point of the space of the two fields thus obtained, which gives the updated model. The quality of the results of any inverse method depends heavily on the realism of the forward modeling. Finite-difference schemes are a good choice relative to realism because, although they are time-consuming, they give excellent results. Numerical tests performed with multioffset synthetic data from a two-dimensional model prove the feasibility of the approach. If only surface-recorded reflections are used, the high spatial frequency content of the model (but not the low spatial frequencies) is recovered in few ({$\simeq$}5) iterations. By using transmitted data also (e.g., between two boreholes), all the spatial frequencies are recovered. Since the problem is nonlinear, if the initial guess is far enough from the true solution, the iterative algorithm may converge into a secondary solution. A nonlinear inversion with 8 shots, each shot recorded at 400 receiver locations, with 700 samples in each seismogram, corresponding to a 2-D model described by 40 000 grid points, takes approximately 1 hour in a CRAY 1S supercomputer.},

  abstract = {A high-order triangular discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is applied to the two-dimensional oceanic shallow water equations. The DG method can be characterized as the fusion of finite elements with finite volumes. This DG formulation uses high-order Lagrange polynomials on the triangle using nodal sets up to 15th order. Both the area and boundary integrals are evaluated using order 2N Gauss cubature rules. The use of exact integration for the area integrals leads naturally to a full mass matrix; however, by using straight-edged triangles we eliminate the mass matrix completely from the discrete equations. Besides obviating the need for a mass matrix, triangular elements offer other obvious advantages in the construction of oceanic shallow water models, specifically the ability to use unstructured grids in order to better represent the continental coastlines for use in tsunami modeling. In this paper, we focus primarily on testing the discrete spatial operators by using six test cases\textemdash three of which have analytic solutions. The three tests having analytic solutions show that the high-order triangular DG method exhibits exponential convergence. Furthermore, comparisons with a spectral element model show that the DG model is superior for all polynomial orders and test cases considered.

It is shown here that, by a recursive scheme related to the multilevel differentiation approach of Volin and Ostrovskii, the growth in both temporal and spatial complexity can be limited to a fixed multiple of log(T). Other compromises between the run time and memory requirement are possible, so that the reverse mode becomes applicable to computational problems of virtually any size.},

For waveform inversion, where the model is expected to have many details reflecting the physical properties of the Earth, regularization and data fitting can work in opposite directions: the former smoothing and the latter adding details to the model. We propose constraining estimated velocity fields by reparameterizing the model. This technique, also called model-space preconditioning, is based on directional Laplacian filters: It preserves most of the details of the velocity model while smoothing the solution along known geological dips. Preconditioning also yields faster convergence at early iterations. The Laplacian filters have the property to smooth or kill local planar events according to a local dip field. By construction, these filters can be inverted and used in a preconditioned waveform inversion strategy to yield geologically meaningful models. We illustrate with 2D synthetic and field data examples how preconditioning with nonstationary directional Laplacian filters outperforms traditional waveform inversion when sparse data are inverted and when sharp velocity contrasts are present. Adding geological information with preconditioning could benefit full-waveform inversion of real data whenever irregular geometry, coherent noise and lack of low frequencies are present.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an efficient discontinuous Galerkin method to simulate wave propagation in heterogeneous media with sub-cell variations. This method is based on a weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin method (WADG), which achieves high order accuracy for arbitrary heterogeneous media. However, the computational cost of WADG grows rapidly with the order of approximation. In this work, we propose a Bernstein-B\textbackslash 'ezier weight-adjusted discontinuous Galerkin method (BBWADG) to address this cost. By approximating sub-cell heterogeneities by a fixed degree polynomial, the main steps of WADG can be expressed as polynomial multiplication and \$L\^2\$ projection, which we carry out using fast Bernstein algorithms. The proposed approach reduces the overall computational complexity from \$O(N\^\{2d\})\$ to \$O(N\^\{d+1\})\$ in \$d\$ dimensions. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of the proposed approach, and computational experiments for a GPU implementation of BBWADG verify that this theoretical complexity is achieved in practice.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Elastic waves, such as Rayleigh and mode-converted waves, together with amplitude versus offset variations, serve as noise in full waveform inversion using the acoustic approximation. Heavy preprocessing must be applied to remove elastic effects to invert land or marine data using the acoustic inversion method in the time or frequency domains. Full waveform inversion using the elastic wave equation should be one alternative; however, multi-parameter inversion is expensive and sensitive to the starting velocity model. We implement full acoustic waveform inversion of synthetic land and marine data in the Laplace domain with minimum preprocessing (i.e., muting) to remove elastic effects. The damping in the Laplace transform can be thought of as an automatic time windowing. Numerical examples show that Laplace-domain acoustic inversion can yield correct smooth velocity models even with the noise originating from elastic waves. This offers the opportunity to develop an accurate smooth starting model for subsequent inversion in the frequency domain.},

  abstract = {The present paper is the lead article in a three-part series on anisotropic mesh adaptation and its applications to structured and unstructured meshes. A flexible approach is proposed and tested on two-dimensional, inviscid and viscous, finite volume and finite element flow solvers, over a wide range of speeds. The directional properties of an interpolation-based error estimate, extracted from the Hessian of the solution, are used to control the size and orientation of mesh edges. The approach is encapsulated into an edge-based anisotropic mesh optimization methodology (MOM), which uses a judicious sequence of four local operations: refinement, coarsening, edge swapping and point movement, to equi-distribute the error estimate along all edges, without any recourse to remeshing. The mesh adaptation convergence of the MOM loop is carefully studied for a wide variety of test cases. The mesh optimization generic coupling of MOM with finite volume and finite element flow solvers is shown to yield the same final mesh no matter what the starting point is. It is also shown that on such optimized meshes, the need for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) stabilization artifices, such as upwinding or artificial viscosity, are drastically reduced, if not altogether eliminated, in most well-posed formulations. These two conclusions can be considered significant steps towards mesh-independent and solver-independent CFD. The structure of the three-part series is thus, 1, general principles; 2, methodology and applications to structured and unstructured grids; 3, applications to three-dimensional flows.

The numerical schemes are constructed with the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization for the spatial variable and the centered second-order finite difference approximation for the temporal variable. Under appropriate regularity assumptions on the solution, the schemes are shown to enjoy the optimal order error bounds in terms of both the spatial mesh-size and the time-step. In Grote and Sch\"otzau (J Sci Comput 40:257\textendash 272, 2009), a fully discrete DG scheme is studied with an explicit finite difference temporal discretization where a CFL condition is required on the mesh-size and the time-step, and optimal order error estimates are derived in the \$\$L\^2(\textbackslash Omega )\$\$L2({$\Omega$})-norm. In comparison, for our fully discrete DG schemes, we do not require a CFL condition on the mesh-size and the time-step, and our optimal order error estimates are derived for the \$\$H\^1(\textbackslash Omega )\$\$H1({$\Omega$})-like norm and the \$\$L\^2(\textbackslash Omega )\$\$L2({$\Omega$})norm.

  abstract = {Full-waveform inversion produces highly resolved images of the subsurface and quantitative estimation of seismic wave velocity, provided that its initial model is kinematically accurate at the longest data wavelengths. If this initialization constraint is not satisfied, iterative model updating tends to stagnate at kinematically incorrect velocity models producing suboptimal images. The source-receiver extension overcomes this ``cycle-skip'' pathology by modeling each trace with its own proper source wavelet, permitting a good data fit throughout the inversion process. Because source wavelets should be constant (or vary systematically) across a shot gather, a measure of source trace dependence, for example, the mean square of the signature-deconvolved wavelet scaled by time lag, can be minimized to update the velocity model. For kinematically simple data, such measures of wavelet variance are mathematically equivalent to traveltime misfit. Thus, the model obtained by source-receiver extended inversion is close to that produced by traveltime tomography, even though the process uses no picked times. For more complex data, in which energy travels from source to receiver by multiple raypaths, Green's function spectral notches may lead to slowly decaying trace-dependent wavelets with energy at time lags unrelated to traveltime error. Tikhonov regularization of the data-fitting problem suppresses these large-lag signals. Numerical examples suggest that this regularized formulation of source-receiver extended inversion is capable of recovering reasonably good velocity models from synthetic transmission and reflection data without stagnation at suboptimal models encountered by standard full-waveform inversion, but with essentially the same computational cost.},

The physical problem of elastic wave propagation in 1D serves as a model system with which the various numerical methods are introduced and compared. The theoretical background is presented with substantial graphical material supporting the concepts. The results can be reproduced with the supplementary electronic material provided as python codes embedded in Jupyter notebooks. The book starts with a primer on the physics of elastic wave propagation, and a chapter on the fundamentals of parallel programming, computational grids, mesh generation, and hardware models. The core of the book is the presentation of numerical solutions of the wave equation with six different methods: 1) the finite-difference method; 2) the pseudospectral method (Fourier and Chebyshev); 3) the linear finite-element method; 4) the spectral-element method; 5) the finite-volume method; and 6) the discontinuous Galerkin method. Each chapter contains comprehension questions, theoretical, and programming exercises. The book closes with a discussion of domains of application and criteria for the choice of a specific numerical method, and the presentation of current challenges.

The study of inverse problems is of vital interest to many areas of science and technology such as geophysical exploration, system identification, nondestructive testing and ultrasonic tomography. The aim of this book is twofold: in the first part, the reader is exposed to the basic notions and difficulties encountered with ill-posed problems. Basic properties of regularization methods for linear ill-posed problems are studied by means of several simple analytical and numerical examples. The second part of the book presents three special nonlinear inverse problems in detail - the inverse spectral problem, the inverse problem of electrical impedance tomography (EIT), and the inverse scattering problem. The corresponding direct problems are studied with respect to existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on parameters. Then some theoretical results as well as numerical procedures for the inverse problems are discussed. In this new edition, the Factorization Method is included as one of the prominent members in this monograph. Since the Factorization Method is particularly simple for the problem of EIT and this field has attracted a lot of attention during the past decade a chapter on EIT has been added in this monograph. The book is highly illustrated and contains many exercises. This together with the choice of material and its presentation in the book are new, thus making it particularly suitable for graduate students in mathematics and engineering.},

  year = {2016},

  abstract = {The classical derivation of elastic full waveform inversion (FWI) by Tarantola (1986) is based on the second order time-domain stress-displacement formulation of the elastic forward problem. However, the implementation of Perfectly-Matched Layer (PML) absorbing boundary conditions and visco-elasticity by relaxation mechanisms is much easier for the stress-velocity formulation. The underlying first order partial differential equations are not self-adjoint and therefore the gradients necessary for a FWI cannot be directly estimated by the adjoint state-method. One solution is to rewrite the displacement-fields in the time-domain gradients from the second order formulation to stress-fields via the stress-strain relationship (K\"ohn et al., 2012; Groos, 2013). The disadvantage of this approach is that the data residuals of the velocity components have to be numerically integrated, which can be a challenging task in field data applications. Other approaches are based on different self-adjoint formulations of the forward problem, like the pseudo-conservative form (Brossier, 2011). Here, we decompose the impedance matrix for the (visco)-elastic problem into a matrix consisting only of the material parameters and another containing only partial derivatives in order to obtain a symmetric hyperbolic problem. Beside a detailed derivation of the FWI gradients, we show some preliminary visco-elastic inversion results for the Marmousi-2 model.

The method utilizes a spatial numerical grid to calculate spatial derivatives by the fast Fourier transform. Time derivatives which appear in the wave equation are calculated by second-order differencing. The scheme requires fewer grid points than finite-difference methods to achieve the same accuracy. It is therefore believed that the Fourier method will prove more efficiency than finite-difference methods, especially when dealing with three-dimensional models. The Fourier forward-modeling method was tested against two problems, a single-layer problem with a known analytic solution and a wedge problem which was also tested by physical modeling. The numerical results agreed with both the analytic and physical model results. Furthermore, the numerical model facilitates the explanation of certain events in the time section of the physical model which otherwise could not easily be taken into account.-Authors},

An adaptive algorithm for such meshes includes the ingredients Error estimation and Information extraction/Mesh refinement. Related articles on a posteriori error estimation on anisotropic meshes revealed that reliable error estimation requires an anisotropic mesh that is aligned with the anisotropic solution. To obtain anisotropic meshes the so-called Hessian strategy is used, which provides information such as the stretching direction and stretching ratio of the anisotropic elements. This article combines the analysis of anisotropic information extraction/mesh refinement and error estimation (for several estimators). It shows that the Hessian strategy leads to well-aligned anisotropic meshes and, consequently, reliable error estimation. The underlying heuristic assumptions are given in a stringent yet general form. Numerical examples strengthen the exposition. Hence the analysis provides further insight into a particular aspect of anisotropic error estimation. \textcopyright{} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper we introduce a multirate numerical scheme with a self-adjusting time stepping strategy. Instead of using a single step size for the whole system, the step size for each component is determined by estimating its own local variation. The stability analysis for the developed scheme is performed and the stability conditions are obtained. The presented multirate scheme provides a significant speed-up in the CPU times compared to the corresponding single-rate one. The use of multiple time steps allows parallel computing.},

This, along with further development by Baysal et al (1983a,b) and Whitmore (1983), has sparked much interest and discussion. In May 1983, Loewenthal and Mufti also published a migration algorithm, quite different from the above, that they call ``reversed time migration'' and developed as early as 1977. In this short note I present a general principle underlying reverse-time migration and discuss the various reverse-time migration procedures in light of it.},

Second, we combine Newton and quasi-Newton optimization methods with source encoding techniques to see to what extent the computational cost could be further reduced. Finally, the optimization process associated to FWI is ill posed and requires regularization constraints. I show that the total variation of the model as a regularization term provides and adequate description of earth models, preserving the discontinuous character of the lithological layers. To improve the quality of the images, we propose a local total variation denoising algorithm based on the incorporation of the information provided by a migrated image.},

Newton's method is practically unfeasible in solving realistic-size FWI problems because of the prohibitive cost (computing time and memory consumption) of calculating the Hessian matrix and the inverse Hessian. Therefore, the Gauss-Newton method and various quasi-Newton methods are proposed to approximate a Hessian matrix. Particularly, current quasi-Newton FWI (QNFWI) commonly uses the limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) method, which, however, only implicitly approximates an inverse Hessian. We repose FWI as a sparse optimization problem in a sparse model space, which contains substantially fewer model parameters that are constrained by structures of the model. With respect to fewer parameters in the sparse model, we can avoid the ``limited-memory'' approximation and are able to explicitly compute and store a projected Hessian matrix that saves the computational time and required memory. We constructed such a projected Hessian matrix by adapting the classic BFGS method to a projected BFGS (P-BFGS) method in the sparse space. Using the projected Hessian matrix and its inverse, we can apply the P-BFGS method to solve FWI with a quasi-Newton method. In QNFWI with P-BFGS because we invert for a sparse model with much fewer parameters, the memory required to compute the projected Hessian is negligible compared to either forward modeling or gradient calculation. QNFWI with P-BFGS converges in fewer iterations than conjugate-gradient based methods and QNFWI with L-BFGS.},

  abstract = {Numerical solutions of the scalar and elastic wave equations have greatly aided geophysicists in both forward modeling and migration of seismic wave fields in complicated geologic media, and they promise to be invaluable in solving the full inverse problem. This paper quantitatively compares finite-difference and finite-element solutions of the scalar and elastic hyperbolic wave equations for the most popular implicit and explicit time-domain and frequency-domain techniques. In addition to versatility and ease of implementation, it is imperative that one choose the most cost effective solution technique for a fixed degree of accuracy. To be of value, a solution technique must be able to minimize (1) numerical attenuation or amplification, (2) polarization errors, (3) numerical anisotropy, (4) errors in phase and group velocities, (5) extraneous numerical (parasitic) modes, (6) numerical diffraction and scattering, and (7) errors and transmission coefficients. This paper shows that in homogeneous media the explicit finite-element and finite-difference schemes are comparable when solving the scalar wave equation and when solving the elastic wave equations with Poisson's ratio less than 0.3. Finite-elements are superior to finite-differences when modeling elastic media with Poisson's ratio between 0.3 and 0.45. For both the scalar and elastic equations, the more costly implicit time integration schemes such as the Newmark scheme are inferior to the explicit central-differences scheme, since time steps surpassing the Courant condition yield stable but highly inaccurate results. Frequency-domain finite-element solutions employing a weighted average of consistent and lumped masses yield the most accurate results, and they promise to be the most cost-effective method for CDP, well log, and interactive modeling.},

We implement the methodology in a 2-D discontinuous Galerkin solver. First, a convergence study confirms the hp-convergence of the method in a smoothly varying elastic medium. Then, we show the advantages of the present methodology, compared to the classical one with constant properties within the elements, in terms of the complexity of the mesh generation process by analysing the seismic amplification of a soft layer over an elastic half-space. Finally, to verify the proposed methodology in a more complex and realistic configuration, we compare the simulation results with the ones obtained by the spectral element method for a sedimentary basin with a realistic gradient velocity profile. Satisfactory results are obtained even for the case where the computational mesh does not honour the strong impedance contrast between the basin bottom and the bedrock.},

  abstract = {Full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful method for reconstructing subsurface parameters from local measurements of the seismic wavefield. This method consists in minimizing the distance between predicted and recorded data. The predicted data are computed as the solution of a wave-propagation problem. Conventional numerical methods for the resolution of FWI problems are gradient-based methods, such as the preconditioned steepest descent, or more recently the \$l\$-BFGS quasi-Newton algorithm. In this study, we investigate the desirability of applying a truncated Newton method to FWI. The inverse Hessian operator plays a crucial role in the parameter reconstruction. The truncated Newton method allows one to better account for this operator. This method is based on the computation of the Newton descent direction by solving the corresponding linear system through an iterative procedure such as the conjugate gradient method. The large-scale nature of FWI problems requires us, however, to carefully implement this method to avoid prohibitive computational costs. First, this requires working in a matrix-free formalism and the capability of computing efficiently Hessian-vector products. To this purpose, we propose general second-order adjoint state formulas. Second, special attention must be paid to define the stopping criterion for the inner linear iterations associated with the computation of the Newton descent direction. We propose several possibilities and establish a theoretical link between the Steihaug--Toint method, based on trust regions, and the Eisenstat and Walker stopping criterion, designed for a method globalized by linesearch. We investigate the application of the truncated Newton method to two test cases: The first is a standard test case in seismic imaging based on the Marmousi II model. The second one is inspired by a near-surface imaging problem for the reconstruction of high-velocity structures. In the latter case, we demonstrate that the presence of large amplitude multiscattered waves prevents standard methods from converging while the truncated Newton method provides more reliable results.},

An alternative strategy is proposed in this study, based on a measure of the misfit computed with an optimal transport distance. This measure allows to account for the lateral coherency of events within the seismograms, instead of considering each seismic trace independently, as is done generally in full waveform inversion. The computation of this optimal transport distance relies on a particular mathematical formulation allowing for the non-conservation of the total energy between seismograms. The numerical solution of the optimal transport problem is performed using proximal splitting techniques. Three synthetic case studies are investigated using this strategy: the Marmousi 2 model, the BP 2004 salt model, and the Chevron 2014 benchmark data. The results emphasize interesting properties of the optimal transport distance. The associated misfit function is less prone to cycle skipping. A workflow is designed to reconstruct accurately the salt structures in the BP 2004 model, starting from an initial model containing no information about these structures. A high-resolution P-wave velocity estimation is built from the Chevron 2014 benchmark data, following a frequency continuation strategy. This estimation explains accurately the data. Using the same workflow, full waveform inversion based on the L2 distance converges towards a local minimum. These results yield encouraging perspectives regarding the use of the optimal transport distance for full waveform inversion: the sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial model is reduced, the reconstruction of complex salt structure is made possible, the method is robust to noise, and the interpretation of seismic data dominated by reflections is enhanced.},

  abstract = {In the recent years, the use of optimal transport distance has yielded significant progress in image processing for pattern recognition, shape identification, and histograms matching. In this study, the use of this distance is investigated for a seismic tomography problem exploiting the complete waveform; the full waveform inversion. In its conventional formulation, this high resolution seismic imaging method is based on the minimization of the L2 distance between predicted and observed data. Application of this method is generally hampered by the local minima of the associated L2 misfit function, which correspond to velocity models matching the data up to one or several phase shifts. Conversely, the optimal transport distance appears as a more suitable tool to compare the misfit between oscillatory signals, for its ability to detect shifted patterns. However, its application to full waveform inversion is not straightforward, as the mass conservation between the compared data can not be guaranteed, a crucial assumption for optimal transport. In this study, the use of a distance based on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm is introduced to overcome this difficulty. Its mathematical link with the optimal transport distance is made clear. An efficient numerical strategy for its computation, based on a proximal splitting technique, is introduced. Each iteration of the corresponding algorithm requires the solution of a linear system which is demonstrated to be a second-order finite-difference discretization of the Poisson equation, for which fast solvers can be used, relying either on the fast Fourier transform or multigrid techniques. The development of this numerical method make possible applications to industrial scale data, involving tenths of millions of discrete unknowns. The results we obtain on such large scale synthetic data illustrate the potentialities of the optimal transport for seismic imaging. Starting from crude initial velocity models, optimal transport based inversion yields significantly better velocity reconstructions than those based on the L2 distance, both in 2D and 3D contexts.},

  abstract = {Optimal transport distance has been recently promoted as a tool to measure the discrepancy between observed and seismic data within the full-waveform-inversion strategy. This high-resolution seismic imaging method, based on a data-fitting procedure, suffers from the nonconvexity of the standard least-squares discrepancy measure, an issue commonly referred to as cycle skipping. The convexity of the optimal transport distance with respect to time shifts makes it a good candidate to provide a more convex misfit function. However, the optimal transport distance is defined only for the comparison of positive functions, while seismic data are oscillatory. A review of the different attempts proposed in the literature to overcome this difficulty is proposed. Their limitations are illustrated: Basically, the proposed strategies are either not applicable to real data, or they lose the convexity property of optimal transport. On this basis, we introduce a novel strategy based on the interpretation of the seismic data in the graph space. Each individual trace is considered, after discretization, as a set of Dirac points in a 2D space, where the amplitude becomes a geometric attribute of the data. This ensures the positivity of the data, while preserving the geometry of the signal. The differentiability of the misfit function is obtained by approximating the Dirac distributions through 2D Gaussian functions. The interest of this approach is illustrated numerically by computing misfit-function maps in schematic examples before moving to more realistic synthetic full-waveform exercises, including the Marmousi model. The better convexity of the graph-based optimal transport distance is shown. On the Marmousi model, starting from a 1D linearly increasing initial model, with data without low frequencies (no energy less than 3~Hz), a meaningful estimation of the P-wave velocity model is recovered, outperforming previously proposed optimal-transport-based misfit functions.},

  abstract = {Conventional full waveform inversion based on the L2 norm is known to suffer from cycle skipping. Numerous techniques have been promoted to face this long term issue, relying on modifications of the function which measures the discrepancy between observed and predicted data. In this study, we propose to measure this discrepancy through the solution of an optimal transport problem. Instead of proceeding to a sample-by-sample comparison of the seismic signal, this offers the possibility to perform a global comparison of the data, taking into account the spatial and time coherency of the predicted and observed shot gathers. The optimal transport problem is reformulated as a non-smooth convex optimization problem, which can be solved efficiently through proximal splitting techniques. As for other modifications of the misfit function, the optimal transport distance is integrated naturally in the FWI workflow through a modification of the adjoint source term. This modified adjoint source is simply the solution of the optimal transport problem. A 2D time-domain acoustic application on the Marmousi 2 model is presented. We show how the sensitivity to the accuracy of the initial model can be reduced using the optimal transport distance.},

This matches the time required to build an arbitrary (unconstrained) Delaunay triangulation and the time required to build an arbitrary constrained (non-Delaunay) triagulation. CDTs, because of their relationship with Delaunay triangulations, have a number of properties that make them useful for the finite-element method. Applications also include motion planning in the presence of polygonal obstacles and constrained Euclidean minimum spanning trees, spanning trees subject to the restriction that some edges are prespecified.},

An exact solution for the constant-velocity acoustic wave equation can be used to simulate the pressure response at any time. For a spatially varying velocity, a one-step method can be developed where no intermediate time responses are required. Using this approach, we have solved for the pressure response at intermediate times and have developed a recursive solution. The solution has a very high degree of accuracy and can be reduced to various finite-difference time-derivative methods, depending on the approximations used. Although the two approaches are closely related, each has advantages, depending on the problem being solved.},

  abstract = {3-D full waveform inversion (FWI) of seismic wavefields is routinely implemented with explicit time-stepping simulators. A clear advantage of explicit time stepping is the avoidance of solving large-scale implicit linear systems that arise with frequency domain formulations. However, FWI using explicit time stepping may require a very fine time step and (as a consequence) significant computational resources and run times. If the computational challenges of wavefield simulation can be effectively handled, an FWI scheme implemented within the frequency domain utilizing only a few frequencies, offers a cost effective alternative to FWI in the time domain. We have therefore implemented a 3-D FWI scheme for elastic wave propagation in the Fourier domain. To overcome the computational bottleneck in wavefield simulation, we have exploited an efficient Krylov iterative solver for the elastic wave equations approximated with second and fourth order finite differences. The solver does not exploit multilevel preconditioning for wavefield simulation, but is coupled efficiently to the inversion iteration workflow to reduce computational cost. The workflow is best described as a series of sequential inversion experiments, where in the case of seismic reflection acquisition geometries, the data has been laddered such that we first image highly damped data, followed by data where damping is systemically reduced. The key to our modelling approach is its ability to take advantage of solver efficiency when the elastic wavefields are damped. As the inversion experiment progresses, damping is significantly reduced, effectively simulating non-damped wavefields in the Fourier domain. While the cost of the forward simulation increases as damping is reduced, this is counterbalanced by the cost of the outer inversion iteration, which is reduced because of a better starting model obtained from the larger damped wavefield used in the previous inversion experiment. For cross-well data, it is also possible to launch a successful inversion experiment without laddering the damping constants. With this type of acquisition geometry, the solver is still quite effective using a small fixed damping constant. To avoid cycle skipping, we also employ a multiscale imaging approach, in which frequency content of the data is also laddered (with the data now including both reflection and cross-well data acquisition geometries). Thus the inversion process is launched using low frequency data to first recover the long spatial wavelength of the image. With this image as a new starting model, adding higher frequency data refines and enhances the resolution of the image. FWI using laddered frequencies with an efficient damping schemed enables reconstructing elastic attributes of the subsurface at a resolution that approaches half the smallest wavelength utilized to image the subsurface.

Here, we concentrate on deriving amplitude-only approaches for both conventional- and logarithmic-based methods. We define two amplitude-only objective functions by simply assuming that the phase of the modelled wavefield is equal to that of the observed wavefield. We do this for both the conventional least-squares approach and the logarithmic approach of Shin and Min. We show that these functions can be optimized using the same reverse-time propagation algorithm of the full conventional methodology. Although the residuals in this case are not really residual wavefields, they can both be considered and utilized in that sense. In contrast to the case for our phase-only algorithms, we show through numerical tests that the conventional amplitude-only inversion is better than the logarithmic method.},

These localized smaller elements create a bottleneck for explicit time-stepping schemes due to the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy stability condition. Recently developed local time stepping (LTS) algorithms reduce the impact of these small elements by locally adapting the time-step size to the size of the element. The recursive, multi-level nature of our LTS scheme introduces an additional challenge, as standard partitioning schemes create a strong load imbalance across processors. We examine the use of multi-constraint graph and hypergraph partitioning tools to achieve effective, load-balanced parallelization. We implement LTS-Newmark in the seismology code SPECFEM3D and compare performance and scalability between different partitioning tools on CPU and GPU clusters using examples from computational seismology.},

A special effort was made to have the material self-contained as much as possible. The book is well suited to numerical analysts interested in DG methods but also to applied mathematicians who study CFD or porous media flow. Practical implementation issues are discussed, which can be of interest to engineers. The material can be used in a graduate level course on the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Chapter 1 is introductory and can be used in a scientific computing class for senior undergraduate students. Prerequisites are calculus and linear algebra. In this book, we mainly focus on the class of primal DG methods, namely variations of interior penalty methods. In the text, these methods are referred to as the symmetric interior penalty Galerkin (SIPG), incomplete interior penalty Galerkin (IIPG), and nonsymmetric interior penalty Galerkin (NIPG) methods. The book is divided into three parts: Part I focuses on the application of DG to second order elliptic problems in one dimension first and then in higher dimensions. In Part II, the time-dependent parabolic problems (without and with convection) are presented. Finally, Part III covers some applications of DG to solid mechanics (linear elasticity), to fluid dynamics (Stokes and Navier\textemdash Stokes), and to porous media flow (two-phase and miscible displacement). We try to discuss both theoretical and computational aspects of the DG methods. In particular, for the elliptic equations, a code written in MATLAB\textregistered{} for one-dimensional problems is provided in Appendix B.1. The text contains algorithms for the implementation of DG methods in two or three dimensions. Corresponding routines written in C are provided in Appendix B.2 as well.},

The classical Rosenbrock function, which is a two-dimensional unimodal function, has been extended to higher dimensions in recent years. Many researchers take the high-dimensional Rosenbrock function as a unimodal function by instinct. In 2001 and 2002, Hansen and Deb found that the Rosenbrock function is not a unimodal function for higher dimensions although no theoretical analysis was provided. This paper shows that the n-dimensional (n = 4 {$\sim$} 30) Rosenbrock function has 2 minima, and analysis is proposed to verify this. The local minima in some cases are presented. In addition, this paper demonstrates that one of the ``local minima'' for the 20-variable Rosenbrock function found by Deb might not in fact be a local minimum.},

In this article, we investigate waveform inversion using full logarithmic principles and compare the results with the conventional least squares approach. We demonstrate theoretically that logarithmic inversion is computational similar to the conventional method in the sense that it uses exactly the same back-propagation technology as used in least-squares inversion. In the sense that it produces better results for each of three numerical examples, we conclude that logarithmic inversion is also more robust. We argue that a major reason for the inherent robustness is the fact that the logarithmic approach produces a natural scaling of the amplitude of the residual wavefield by the amplitude of the modelled wavefield that tends to stabilize the computations and consequently improve the final result. We claim that any superiority of the logarithmic inversion is based on the fact that it tends to be tomographic in the early stage of the inversion and more dependent on amplitude differences in the latter stages.},

  abstract = {Since the pioneering work of Tarantola, waveform inversion has emerged as a tool for estimating velocity models of the subsurface using pre-stack seismic data. The waveform inversions have usually been performed in the time or frequency domain, but this can make it difficult to recover long-wavelength components of the velocity model due to the high non-linearity of the objective function and the lack of low-frequency components in the field data. Instead, it has been recently suggested that Laplace-domain waveform inversion can circumvent these limitations. By using the zero-frequency component of the damped wavefield, the Laplace-domain waveform inversion can recover long-wavelength structures of the velocity model even if low-frequency components less than 5 Hz are unreliable or would be unusable in conventional inversions. The main drawback is that the penetration depth of the Laplace-domain inversion depends on the offset distance and the choice of Laplace damping constants.In this paper, we propose an improved Laplace\textemdash Fourier-domain waveform inversion to compensate for these weak points. This is accomplished by exploiting low frequency components (less than 5 Hz) of the damped wavefield. The success of this technique arises from the `mirage-like' resurrection of low-frequency components less than 5 Hz and the unique characteristics of the complex logarithmic wavefield. The latter is capable of separating the wavefield into amplitude and phase components, allowing us to simultaneously generate both long-wavelength and medium-short-wavelength velocity models.We successfully applied the Laplace\textemdash Fourier-domain waveform inversion to a synthetic data set of the BP model calculated using the time-domain finite difference method. This not only produced a more refined velocity model when compared to Laplace-domain inversion results, but it also improved the penetration depth of the inversion. Furthermore, when the velocity model produced by the Laplace\textemdash Fourier-domain waveform inversion was then used as an initial velocity model of a conventional frequency-domain inversion, we obtained an inverted velocity model containing almost every feature of the true BP model.We applied our two-step, Laplace-domain waveform inversion to field data and obtained a refined velocity model containing short- and long-wavelength components. To convince ourselves of the accuracy of the inversion results, we computed a synthetic model using the estimated source wavelet and our velocity model from the inversion, and we obtained a migrated image and angle-domain common-image gathers at several points by a reverse-time pre-stack depth migration in the frequency domain. The reconstructed synthetic data were in good agreement with the field data and most parts of the reflections in the image gathers were flattened.},

As an alternative to classical waveform inversion, we propose the use of a new, objective function constructed by taking the logarithm of wavefields, allowing consideration of three types of objective function, namely, amplitude only, phase only, or both. In our wave form inversion, we estimate the source signature as well as the velocity structure by including functions of amplitudes and phases of the source signature in the objective function. We compute the steepest-descent directions by using a matrix formalism derived from a frequency-domain, finite-element/finite-difference modeling technique. Our numerical algorithms are similar to those of reverse-time migration and waveform inversion based on the adjoint state of the wave equation. In order to demonstrate the practical applicability of our algorithm, we use a synthetic data set from the Marmousi model and seismic data collected from the Korean continental shelf. For noise-free synthetic data, the velocity structure produced by our inversion algorithm is closer to the true velocity structure than that obtained with conventional waveform inversion. When random noise is added, the inverted velocity model is also close to the true Marmousi model, but when frequencies below 5Hz5Hz{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}5{$<$}/mn{$><$}mspace width="0.3em"{$><$}/mspace{$><$}mi{$>$}Hz{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} are removed from the data, the velocity structure is not as good as those for the noise-free and noisy data. For field data, we compare the time-domain synthetic seismograms generated for the velocity model inverted by our algorithm with real seismograms and find that the results show that our inversion algorithm reveals short-period features of the subsurface. Although we use wrapped phases in our examples, we still obtain reasonable results. We expect that if we were to use correctly unwrapped phases in the inversion algorithm, we would obtain better results.},

  abstract = {The key computational kernel of most advanced 3D seismic imaging and inversion algorithms used in exploration seismology involves calculating solutions of the 3D acoustic wave equation, most commonly with a finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) methodology. Although well suited for regularly sampled rectilinear computational domains, FDTD methods seemingly have limited applicability in scenarios involving irregular 3D domain boundary surfaces and mesh interiors best described by non-Cartesian geometry (e.g., surface topography). Using coordinate mapping relationships and differential geometry, an FDTD approach can be developed for generating solutions to the 3D acoustic wave equation that is applicable to generalized 3D coordinate systems and (quadrilateral-faced hexahedral) structured meshes. The developed numerical implementation is similar to the established Cartesian approaches, save for a necessary introduction of weighted first- and mixed second-order partial-derivative operators that account for spatially varying geometry. The approach was validated on three different types of computational meshes: (1) an ``internal boundary'' mesh conforming to a dipping water bottom layer, (2) analytic ``semiorthogonal cylindrical'' coordinates, and (3) analytic semiorthogonal and numerically specified ``topographic'' coordinate meshes. Impulse response tests and numerical analysis demonstrated the viability of the approach for kernel computations for 3D seismic imaging and inversion experiments for non-Cartesian geometry scenarios.},

The method is fully explicit, high-order accurate in both space and time, and coincides with the classic discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with upwinding fluxes for a particular choice of its stabilization function. This means that it has the same computational complexity as other explicit DG methods. However, just as its implicit version, it provides optimal convergence of order k+1 for all the approximate variables including the gradient of the solution, and, when the time-stepping method is of order k+2, it displays a superconvergence property which allow us, by means of local postprocessing, to obtain new improved approximations of the scalar field variables at any time levels for which an enhanced accuracy is required. In particular, the new approximations converge with order k+2 in the L2-norm for k{$\geq$}1. These properties do not hold for all numerical fluxes. Indeed, our results show that, when the HDG numerical flux is replaced by the Lax\textendash Friedrichs flux, the above-mentioned superconvergence properties are lost, although some are recovered when the Lax\textendash Friedrichs flux is used only in the interior of the domain. Finally, we extend the explicit HDG method to treat the wave equation with perfectly matched layers. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

It is, however, a highly nonlinear inverse problem; thus, we iteratively update the subsurface model by minimizing a misfit function that measures the difference between the measured and the predicted data. The conventional l2l2{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}msub{$><$}mrow{$><$}mi{$>$}l{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow{$><$}mn{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}-norm misfit function is widely used because it provides a simple, high-resolution misfit function with a sample-by-sample comparison. However, it is susceptible to local minima if the low-wavenumber components of the initial model are not accurate. Deconvolution of the predicted and measured data offers an extended space comparison, which is more global. The matching filter calculated from the deconvolution has energy focused at zero lag, like an approximated Dirac delta function, when the predicted data matches the measured one. We have introduced a framework for designing misfit functions by measuring the distance between the matching filter and a representation of the Dirac delta function using optimal transport theory. We have used the Wasserstein W2W2{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}W{$<$}/mi{$><$}mn{$>$}2{$<$}/mn{$><$}/msub{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$} distance, which provides us with the optimal transport between two probability distribution functions. Unlike data, the matching filter can be easily transformed to a probability distribution satisfying the requirement of the optimal transport theory. Though in one form, it admits the conventional normalized penalty applied to the nonzero-lag energy in the matching filter, the proposed misfit function is metric and extracts its form from solid mathematical foundations based on optimal transport theory. Explicitly, we can derive the adaptive waveform inversion (AWI) misfit function based on our framework, and the critical ``normalization'' for AWI occurs naturally per the requirement of a probability distribution. We use a modified Marmousi model and the BP salt model to verify the features of the proposed method in avoiding cycle skipping. We use the Chevron 2014 FWI benchmark data set to further highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

We implement the continuous adjoint method to serve as a benchmark, additionally allowing for simulating off-axis sources in axisymmetric or 3-D models. The kernels generated by both methods are compared to each other, and benchmarked against theoretical predictions based on linearized Born theory, providing an excellent fit to this independent reference solution. Our verification benchmarks show that the discrete adjoint method can produce exact kernels, largely identical to continuous kernels. While using the continuous adjoint method we lose the computational advantage and fall back on a full-3-D frequency scaling, using the discrete adjoint retains the speedup offered by AxiSEM3D. We also discuss the creation of a data-coverage based mesh to run the simulations on during the inversion process, which would allow to exploit the flexibility of the Fourier parametrization and thus the speedup offered by our method.},

Multiply reflected energy is naturally taken into account, as well as refracted energy or surface waves. The inverse problem can be solved using an iterative algorithm which gives, at each iteration, updated values of bulk modulus, density, and time source function. Each step of the iterative algorithm essentially consists of a forward propagation of the actual sources in the current model and a forward propagation (backward in time) of the data residuals. The correlation at each point of the space of the two fields thus obtained yields the corrections of the bulk modulus and density models. This shows, in particular, that the general solution of the inverse problem can be attained by methods strongly related to the methods of migration of unstacked data, and commercially competitive with them.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             We present a novel full-waveform inversion (FWI) approach which can reduce the computational cost by up to an order of magnitude compared to conventional approaches, provided that variations in medium properties are sufficiently smooth. Our method is based on the usage of wavefield adapted meshes which accelerate the forward and adjoint wavefield simulations. By adapting the mesh to the expected complexity and smoothness of the wavefield, the number of elements needed to discretize the wave equation can be greatly reduced. This leads to spectral-element meshes which are optimally tailored to source locations and medium complexity. We demonstrate a workflow which opens up the possibility to use these meshes in FWI and show the computational advantages of the approach. We provide examples in 2-D and 3-D to illustrate the concept, describe how the new workflow deviates from the standard FWI workflow, and explain the additional steps in detail.},

In condensed matter physics, annealing denotes a physical process in which a solid in a heat bath is heated up by increasing the temperature of the heat bath to a maximum value at which all particles of the solid randomly arrange themselves in the liquid phase, followed by cooling through slowly lowering the temperature of the heat bath. In this way, all particles arrange themselves in the low energy ground state of a corresponding lattice, provided the maximum temperature is sufficiently high and the cooling is carried out sufficiently slowly. Starting off at the maximum value of the temperature, the cooling phase of the annealing process can be described as follows.},

Exploration in geologically more complex areas exceeds the abilities of existing methods. New data-acquisition and data-processing methods are required to answer these new challenges effectively. The recently introduced wide-azimuth data acquisition method offers better illumination and noise attenuation as well as an opportunity to more accurately determine velocities for imaging. One of the most advanced tools for depth imaging is full-waveform inversion. Prestack seismic full-waveform inversion is very challenging because of the nonlinearity and nonuniqueness of the solution. Combined with multiple iterations of forward modeling and residual wavefield back propagation, the method is computer intensive, especially for 3D projects. We studied a time-domain, plane-wave implementation of 3D waveform inversion. We found that plane-wave gathers are an attractive input to waveform inversion with dramatically reduced computer run times compared to traditional shot-gather approaches. The study was conducted on two synthetic data sets \textemdash{} Marmousi2 and SMAART Pluto 1.5 \textemdash{} and a field data set. The results showed that a velocity field can be reconstructed well using a multiscale time-domain implementation of waveform inversion. Although the time-domain solution does not take advantage of wavenumber redundancy, the method is feasible on current computer architectures for 3D surveys. The inverted velocity volume produces a quality image for exploration geologists by using numerous iterations of waveform inversion.},

Evans, University of California at Berkeley In 1781, Gaspard Monge defined the problem of ``optimal transportation'', or the transferring of mass with the least possible amount of work, with applications to engineering in mind. In 1942, Leonid Kantorovich applied the newborn machinery of linear programming to Monge's problem, with applications to economics in mind. In 1987, Yann Brenier used optimal transportation to prove a new projection theorem on the set of measure preserving maps, with applications to fluid mechanics in mind. Each of these contributions marked the beginning of a whole mathematical theory, with many unexpected ramifications. Nowadays, the Monge-Kantorovich problem is used and studied by researchers from extremely diverse horizons, including probability theory, functional analysis, isoperimetry, partial differential equations, and even meteorology. Originating from a graduate course, the present volume is at once an introduction to the field of optimal transportation and a survey of the research on the topic over the last 15 years. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers, and it covers both theory and applications. Readers are only assumed to be familiar with the basics of measure theory and functional analysis.},

In particular, we are concerned with solving this equation on a large domain, for a large number of different forcing terms in the context of seismic problems in general, and modeling in particular. We resort to a parsimonious mixed grid finite differences scheme for discretizing the Helmholtz operator and Perfect Matched Layer boundaries, resulting in a non-Hermitian matrix. We make use of a nested dissection based domain decomposition, and introduce an approximate direct solver by developing a parallel HSS matrix compression, factorization, and solution approach. We cast our massive parallelization in the framework of the multifrontal method. The assembly tree is partitioned into local trees and a global tree. The local trees are eliminated independently in each processor, while the global tree is eliminated through massive communication. The solver for the inhomogeneous equation is a parallel hybrid between multifrontal and HSS structure. The computational complexity associated with the factorization is almost linear in the size, n say, of the matrix, viz. between O(n log n) and O(n4/3 log n), while the storage is almost linear as well, between O(n) and O(n log n). We exploit the use of a regular (Cartesian) mesh common in many seismic applications.},

  abstract = {Seismic imaging is a geophysical technique assisting in the understanding of subsurface structure on a regional and global scale. With the development of computer technology, computationally intensive seismic algorithms have begun to gain attention in both academia and industry. These algorithms typically produce high-quality subsurface images or models, but require intensive computations for solving wave equations. Achieving high-fidelity wave simulations is challenging: first, numerical wave solutions may suffer from dispersion and dissipation errors in long-distance propagations; second, the efficiency of wave simulators is crucial for many seismic applications. High-order methods have advantages of decreasing numerical errors efficiently and hence are ideal for wave modelings in seismic problems. Various high order wave solvers have been studied for seismic imaging. One of the most popular solvers is the finite difference time domain (FDTD) methods. The strengths of finite difference methods are the computational efficiency and ease of implementation, but the drawback of FDTD is the lack of geometric flexibility. It has been shown that standard finite difference methods suffer from first order numerical errors at sharp media interfaces. In contrast to finite difference methods, discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods, a class of high-order numerical methods built on unstructured meshes, enjoy geometric flexibility and smaller interface errors. Additionally, DG methods are highly parallelizable and have explicit semi-discrete form, which makes DG suitable for large-scale wave simulations. In this dissertation, the discontinuous Galerkin methods on hybrid meshes are developed and applied to two seismic algorithms---reverse time migration (RTM) and full waveform inversion (FWI). This thesis describes in depth the steps taken to develop a forward DG solver for the framework that efficiently exploits the element specific structure of hexahedral, tetrahedral, prismatic and pyramidal elements. In particular, we describe how to exploit the tensor-product property of hexahedral elements, and propose the use of hex-dominant meshes to speed up the computation. The computational efficiency is further realized through a combination of graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration and multi-rate time stepping. As DG methods are highly parallelizable, we build the DG solver on multiple GPUs with element-specific kernels. Implementation details of memory loading, workload assignment and latency hiding are discussed in the thesis. In addition, we employ a multi-rate time stepping scheme which allows different elements to take different time steps. This thesis applies DG schemes to RTM and FWI to highlight the strengths of the DG methods. For DG-RTM, we adopt the boundary value saving strategy to avoid data movement on GPUs and utilize the memory load in the temporal updating procedure to produce images of higher qualities without a significant extra cost. For DG-FWI, a derivation of the DG-specific adjoint-state method is presented for the fully discretized DG system. Finally, sharp media interfaces are inverted by specifying perturbations of element faces, edges and vertices.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the computation of derivatives for optimization problems governed by linear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations (PDEs) that are discretized by the discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method. An efficient and accurate computation of these derivatives is important, for instance, in inverse problems and optimal control problems. This computation is usually based on an adjoint PDE system, and the question addressed in this paper is how the discretization of this adjoint system should relate to the dG discretization of the hyperbolic state equation. Adjoint-based derivatives can either be computed before or after discretization; these two options are often referred to as the optimize-then-discretize and discretize-then-optimize approaches. We discuss the relation between these two options for dG discretizations in space and Runge-Kutta time integration. Discretely exact discretizations for several hyperbolic optimization problems are derived, including the advection equation, Maxwell's equations and the coupled elastic-acoustic wave equation. We find that the discrete adjoint equation inherits a natural dG discretization from the discretization of the state equation and that the expressions for the discretely exact gradient often have to take into account contributions from element faces. For the coupled elastic-acoustic wave equation, the correctness and accuracy of our derivative expressions are illustrated by comparisons with finite difference gradients. The results show that a straightforward discretization of the continuous gradient differs from the discretely exact gradient, and thus is not consistent with the discretized objective. This inconsistency may cause difficulties in the convergence of gradient based algorithms for solving optimization problems.},

A velocity\textendash strain formulation is used, which allows for the solution of the acoustic and elastic wave equations within the same unified framework. Careful attention is directed at the derivation of a numerical flux that preserves high-order accuracy in the presence of material discontinuities, including elastic\textendash acoustic interfaces. Explicit expressions for the 3D upwind numerical flux, derived as an exact solution for the relevant Riemann problem, are provided. The method supports h-non-conforming meshes, which are particularly effective at allowing local adaptation of the mesh size to resolve strong contrasts in the local wavelength, as well as dynamic adaptivity to track solution features. The use of high-order elements controls numerical dispersion, enabling propagation over many wave periods. We prove consistency and stability of the proposed dG scheme. To study the numerical accuracy and convergence of the proposed method, we compare against analytical solutions for wave propagation problems with interfaces, including Rayleigh, Lamb, Scholte, and Stoneley waves as well as plane waves impinging on an elastic\textendash acoustic interface. Spectral rates of convergence are demonstrated for these problems, which include a non-conforming mesh case. Finally, we present scalability results for a parallel implementation of the proposed high-order dG scheme for large-scale seismic wave propagation in a simplified earth model, demonstrating high parallel efficiency for strong scaling to the full size of the Jaguar Cray XT5 supercomputer.},

  abstract = {We present a robust and efficient target-based mesh adaptation methodology, building on hybridized discontinuous Galerkin schemes for (nonlinear) convection-diffusion problems, including the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations. Hybridization of finite element discretizations has the main advantage, that the resulting set of algebraic equations has globally coupled degrees of freedom only on the skeleton of the computational mesh. Consequently, solving for these degrees of freedom involves the solution of a potentially much smaller system. This not only reduces storage requirements, but also allows for a faster solution with iterative solvers. The mesh adaptation is driven by an error estimate obtained via a discrete adjoint approach. Furthermore, the computed target functional can be corrected with this error estimate to obtain an even more accurate value. The aim of this paper is twofold: Firstly, to show the superiority of adjoint-based mesh adaptation over uniform and residual-based mesh refinement, and secondly to investigate the efficiency of the global error estimate.},

  abstract = {In seismic exploration, sources and measurements of seismic waves on the surface are used to determine model parameters representing geophysical properties of the earth. Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a nonlinear seismic inverse technique that inverts the model parameters by minimizing the difference between the synthetic data from the forward wave propagation and the observed true data in PDE-constrained optimization. The traditional least-squares method of measuring this difference suffers from three main drawbacks including local minima trapping, sensitivity to noise, and difficulties in reconstruction below reflecting layers. Unlike the local amplitude comparison in the least-squares method, the quadratic Wasserstein distance from the optimal transport theory considers both the amplitude differences and the phase mismatches when measuring data misfit. We will briefly review our earlier development and analysis of optimal transport-based inversion and include improvements, for example, a stronger convexity proof. The main focus will be on the third ``challenge'' with new results on sub-reflection recovery.},

  abstract = {Conventional full-waveform inversion (FWI) using the least-squares norm as a misfit function is known to suffer from cycle-skipping issues that increase the risk of computing a local rather than the global minimum of the misfit. The quadratic Wasserstein metric has proven to have many ideal properties with regard to convexity and insensitivity to noise. When the observed and predicted seismic data are considered to be two density functions, the quadratic Wasserstein metric corresponds to the optimal cost of rearranging one density into the other, in which the transportation cost is quadratic in distance. Unlike the least-squares norm, the quadratic Wasserstein metric measures not only amplitude differences but also global phase shifts, which helps to avoid cycle-skipping issues. We have developed a new way of using the quadratic Wasserstein metric trace by trace in FWI and compare it with the global quadratic Wasserstein metric via the solution of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We incorporate the quadratic Wasserstein metric technique into the framework of the adjoint-state method and apply it to several 2D examples. With the corresponding adjoint source, the velocity model can be updated using a quasi-Newton method. Numerical results indicate the effectiveness of the quadratic Wasserstein metric in alleviating cycle-skipping issues and sensitivity to noise. The mathematical theory and numerical examples demonstrate that the quadratic Wasserstein metric is a good candidate for a misfit function in seismic inversion.},

  abstract = {Conventional full waveform inversion (FWI) using least square distance (L2 norm) between the observed and predicted seismograms suffers from local minima. Recently, the Wasserstein metric (W1 metric) has been introduced to FWI to compute the misfit between two seismograms. Instead of comparisons bin by bin, the W1 metric allows to compare signal intensities across different coordinates. This measure has great potential to account for time and space shifts of events within seismograms. However, there are two main challenges in application of the W1 metric to FWI. The first one is that the compared signals need to satisfy nonnegativity and mass conservation assumptions. The second one is that the computation of W1 metric between two seismograms is a computationally expensive problem. In this paper, a strategy is used to satisfy the two assumptions via decomposition and recombination of original seismic data. In addition, the computation of the W1 metric based on dynamic formulation is formulated as a convex optimization problem. A primal-dual hybrid gradient method with linesearch has been developed to solve this large-scale optimization problem on GPU device. The advantages of the new method are that it is easy to implement and has high computational efficiency. Compared to the L2 norm based FWI, the computation time of the proposed method will approximately increase by 11\% in our case studies. A 1D time-shift signals case study has indicated that the W1 metric is more effective in capturing time shift and makes the misfit function more convex. Two applications to synthetic data using transmissive and reflective recording geometries have demonstrated the effectiveness of the W1 metric in mitigating cycle-skipping issues. We have also applied the proposed method to SEG 2014 benchmark data, which has further demonstrated that the W1 metric can mitigate local minima and provide reliable velocity estimations without using low frequency information in the recorded data.},

  abstract = {We have developed a wavelet-multiscale adjoint scheme for the elastic full-waveform inversion of seismic data, including body waves (BWs) and surface waves (SWs). We start the inversion on the SW portion of the seismograms. To avoid cycle skipping and reduce the dependence on the initial model of these dispersive waves, we commence by minimizing an envelope-based misfit function. Subsequently, we proceed to the minimization of a waveform-difference (WD) metric applied to the SWs only. After that, we fit BWs and SWs indiscriminately using a WD misfit metric. In each of these three steps, we guide the iterative inversion through a sequence of nested subspace projections in a wavelet basis. SW analysis preserves a wealth of near-surface features that would be lost in conventional BW tomography. We used a toy model to illustrate the dispersive and cycle-skipping behavior of the SWs, and to introduce the two ways by which we combat the nonlinearity of waveform inversions involving SWs. The first is the wavelet-based multiscale character of the method, and the second the envelope-based misfit function. Next, we used an industry synthetic model to perform realistic numerical experiments to further develop a strategy for SW and joint SW as well as BW tomography. The effect of incorrect density information on wave-speed inversions was also evaluated. We ultimately formalize a flexible scheme for full-waveform inversion based on adjoint methods that includes BWs and SWs, and also considers P- and S-wave speeds, as well as density. Our method is applicable to waveform inversion in exploration geophysics, geotechnical engineering, regional, and global seismology.},

Its numerical solution is studied in this paper using an adaptive moving mesh discontinuous Galerkin method for spatial discretization together with the discrete ordinate method for angular discretization. The former employs a dynamic mesh adaptation strategy based on moving mesh partial differential equations to improve computational accuracy and efficiency. Its mesh adaptation ability, accuracy, and efficiency are demonstrated in a selection of one- and two-dimensional numerical examples.},

This AMF is designed to measure time-varying phase differences between observations and predictions. Compared with classical least-squares waveform differences, our misfit function behaves as a smooth, quadratic function with a broad basin of attraction. These characters are important because local gradient-based optimization approaches used in most FWI schemes cannot guarantee convergence toward true models if misfit functions include local minima or if the starting model is far away from the global minimum. The 1D and 2D synthetic experiments illustrate the advantages of the proposed misfit function compared with the classical least-squares waveform misfit. Furthermore, we have derived adjoint sources associated with the proposed misfit function and applied them in several 2D time-domain acoustic FWI experiments. Numerical results found that the proposed misfit function can provide good starting models for FWI, particularly when low-frequency signals are absent in recorded data.},
